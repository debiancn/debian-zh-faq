#LaTeX2HTML Version 96.1 : dot.latex2html-init
#
### Command Line Argument Defaults #######################################

#$HTML_VERSION = 4.0;

#$MAX_SPLIT_DEPTH = 0;	# Stop making separate files at this depth

#$DESTDIR = '';         # Put the result in this directory 

# When this is set, the generated HTML files will be placed in the 
# current directory. If set to 0 the default behaviour is to create (or reuse)
# another file directory.
#$NO_SUBDIR = 0;

# Supply your own string if you don't like the default <Name> <Date>
#$ADDRESS = "<I>$address_data[0] <BR>\n$address_data[1]</I>";

#$NO_NAVIGATION = 1;	# 1 = do not put a navigation panel at the top of each page

#$INFO = 0;              # 0 = do not make a "About this document..." section 

# Reuse images generated during previous runs
$REUSE = 2;

### Other global variables ###############################################
#$CHILDLINE = "<BR> <HR>\n";

# Affects ONLY the way accents are processed 
#$default_language = 'english';

# The value of this variable determines how many words to use in each 
# title that is added to the navigation panel (see below)
# 
#$WORDS_IN_NAVIGATION_PANEL_TITLES = 4;

# This number will determine the size of 
# image generating environments such as "figure", "table" or "minipage".
# Effective values are those greater than 0.
# Sensible values are between 0.1 - 4.
#$FIGURE_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.6;

#  If this is set then intermediate files are left for later inspection.
#  This includes $$_images.tex and $$_images.log created during image
#  conversion.
#  Caution: Intermediate files can be *enormous*.
#$DEBUG = 0;

#  If both of the following two variables are set then the "Up" button
#  of the navigation panel in the first node/page of a converted document
#  will point to $EXTERNAL_UP_LINK. $EXTERNAL_UP_TITLE should be set
#  to some text which describes this external link.
#$EXTERNAL_UP_LINK = "";
#$EXTERNAL_UP_TITLE = "";

#$PAPERSIZE = "letter";

# Replace "english" with another language in order to tell LaTeX2HTML that you 
# want some generated section titles (eg "Table of Contents" or "References")
# to appear in a different language. Currently only "english" and "french"
# is supported but it is very easy to add your own. See the example in the
# file "latex2html.config" 
#$TITLES_LANGUAGE = "english";

# $CHARSET = $TITLES_LANGUAGE.'encoding';
$CHARSET = "big5";
$default_language = "chineseb5";
$TITLES_LANGUAGE = "chineseb5";
